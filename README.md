=====================property management app====================

Hi, so here is how far I could go,

I got the CRUD part done

Validation done

Image Resize with image intervention

Landing page list is LIFO

I imported the data from the API

I used bootstrap so it doesn't look like awful


-------------------to use-----------
- run "php artisan migrate"
- run "php artisan serve"
- click 'load from API' on home page (takes about 5 minutes to load all records) 

========whats left=====
-make search work
-make whole app look pretty
-optimize API reader for bigger datasets
